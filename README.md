very cool 2-D rhythm game

# design goals
- use minimal/reusable code for general functionality
- custom charting w/ Reaper, MIDI parsing with C++ (to-do)
- customizability

# to-do, features to add
- sustain (just a matter of .blitting a rect() for some # px after note)
- post-game score/stats screen
- menu screen in progress
- add guitar controller support via usb dongle (wii)
