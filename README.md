# pyHero
2-D rhythm game in the style of Guitar Hero

# design goals
- build a framework for this style of rhythm games around minimal pygame methods
- abstract global constants/static data away from main game loops and functions

# to-do, features to add
- chords
- sustain (just a matter of .blitting a rect() for some # frames after note)
- add guitar controller suport via usb dongle (wii)
