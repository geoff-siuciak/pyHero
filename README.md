# pyHero
2-D rhythm game in the style of Guitar Hero

# design goals
- focus on clarity and customizability
- abstract global constants/static data away from main game loops and functions

# to-do, features to add
- chords
- sustain (just a matter of .blitting a rect() for some # frames after note)
- post-game score/stats screen
- add guitar controller support via usb dongle (wii)
