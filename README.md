# pyHero
2-D rhythm game in the style of Guitar Hero

# design goals
- focus on clarity, intuition, and customizability
- abstract global constants/static data away from main game loops and functions
- 

# to-do, features to add
- chords
- sustain (just a matter of .blitting a rect() for some # frames after note)
- add guitar controller suport via usb dongle (wii)
